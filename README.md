# onset-custom-objects

## What is this?

This is just a simple script that you can use to add (yes) and not replace objects to your Onset game server.  This piece of code is untested but might be a good base to develop something like this.

This is possible as of Onset's version 1.1.0 which removed the restriction of using *valid* game object model IDs, this was made for such scripts to be possible.

The game has 1843 objects to be exact as of writing, so a good practice would be to use all your custom objects to follow the model IDs of above 5000 to keep it future-proof until we can have a more robust solution in the game for something like this.
